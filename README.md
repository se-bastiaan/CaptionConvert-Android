CaptionConvert-Android [![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/se-bastiaan/CaptionConvert-Android.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#se-bastiaan/CaptionConvert-Android)
======

A library for Android based on [JDaren's subtitleConverter](https://github.com/JDaren/subtitleConverter).

This was initially used in Popcorn Time for Android. But since it might have more usages it was turned into a library.

## How to use

Add Jitpack in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

Add to your dependencies:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile "com.github.se-bastiaan:TorrentStream-Android:${torrentstreamVersion}"
}
```
